Question: Task Scheduling System
You are building a task scheduling system. The system should manage tasks with different priorities and process them efficiently.

Requirements:
New tasks can be added to the system at any time. Each task has:

A task_id (a unique identifier).
A priority (integer value, where higher numbers indicate higher priority).
The system should process tasks in the following order:

High-priority tasks first: Tasks with higher priority should be processed before lower-priority tasks.
FIFO order for tasks with the same priority: If two tasks have the same priority, the one that was added earlier should be processed first (like a queue).
The system should support the following operations:

Add task: Add a new task with a specific priority.
Process next task: Process and remove the task with the highest priority from the system. If multiple tasks have the same priority, process the one added first.
You will use deque, list, and queue-like structures to implement this system.\

Task_1=['adding']
Task_2=['multi']
Task_3=['subst']

Priority_1=[1]
Priority_2=[2]
Priority_3=[3]

Processing_task_1 = Task_1.append(Priority_1)
Processing_task_2 = Task_2.append(Priority_2)
Processing_task_3 = Task_3.append(Priority_3)

Task= (Task_1,Processing_task_1),(Task_2,Processing_task_2),(Task_3,Processing_task_3)

print(Task)


Task_1=['adding']
Task_2=['multi']
Task_3=['subst']

Priority_1=[1]
Priority_2=[2]
Priority_3=[3]

Processing_task_1 = Task_1.append(Priority_1)
Processing_task_2 = Task_2.append(Priority_2)
Processing_task_3 = Task_3.append(Priority_3)

Task=[ Processing_task_1,Processing_task_2,Processing_task_3]
print(Task)
