Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines 
summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the 
phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same 
directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file 
and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the 
entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.
